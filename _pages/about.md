Hi, I am Hailong Yan (严海龙), currently pursuing my Master's degree in the School of Information and Communication Engineering (SICE) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). In addition, I am currently working as a research intern at [Vivo (Shanghai)](https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch).

My current research focuses on **LLM-driven Multimodal Agents** and **Efficient Low-Level Vision**.

**Looking for PhD Opportunities (Fall 2027)**  
I am actively looking for PhD positions starting in Fall 2027. If my background and research interests align with your group, please feel free to contact me at Email: yanhailong@std.uestc.edu.cn.
