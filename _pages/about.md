<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in the School of Information and Communication Engineering (SICE) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the joint supervision of [Prof. Le Zhang](http://zhangleuestc.cn/) and [Prof. Ce Zhu](https://www.avc2-lab.net/~eczhu/). I earned my Bachelor's degree from Southwest University (SWU), where I was advised by [Prof. Junjian Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iuXJAt4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests lie in Efficient Low-Level Vision and Multimodal Large Language Models. In addition, I am currently working as a research intern at Vivo (Shanghai).
